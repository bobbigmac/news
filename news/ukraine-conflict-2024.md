## Overview

The conflict in Ukraine continues into its third year, with significant developments in military strategy, diplomatic efforts, and humanitarian impact. This ongoing story tracks the major events and their implications for regional and global stability.

## Recent Military Developments

The winter months have seen a shift in military tactics, with both sides adapting to the challenging conditions. Ukrainian forces have maintained their defensive positions while continuing targeted counteroffensive operations in key areas.

### Eastern Front

Recent fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions has intensified, with both sides reporting gains and losses. The strategic importance of these areas continues to drive military operations despite the harsh winter conditions.

### Southern Operations

Ukrainian forces have maintained pressure in the southern regions, particularly around Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. These operations aim to disrupt Russian supply lines and create opportunities for future advances.

## Diplomatic Efforts

International diplomatic efforts have intensified as the conflict's impact on global food and energy security becomes more apparent. Multiple peace initiatives have been proposed, though significant obstacles remain.
